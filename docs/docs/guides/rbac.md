## Introduction

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a system that allows you to manage user permissions in Vydon.

:::warning Not yet enforced in the OSS distribution
The frontend Members and Invite surfaces ship in the OSS codebase and
the Casbin role schema is present in the Postgres migrations, but the
backend enforcement service that turns these into per-request
permission checks is still being reimplemented as a native OSS module.
Until that lands, **every authenticated account behaves as Account
Admin** regardless of the role assigned in the UI. This guide is the
target specification for the upcoming enforcement layer.
:::

## How to configure RBAC

RBAC is configured in the Vydon UI under the `Settings` page in the `Members` tab.

When inviting a new user to your team, the role of the user will be selected during the invitation process.

After a user has accepted their invitation and they become a member, the role of the user can be changed in the `Members` tab.

> If you incorrectly set the role during the invite, the invite may be removed and a new invite may be sent with the correct role.

In the member's table, click the three dots on the right side of the row and select `Update Role`.

You'll be presented with a role update form modal where the role may be updated.

> Only admins may update the role of users.

## Roles

The following roles are available for configuration:

### Account Admin

This is the most permissive role for an account and grants full access to all features and settings within the account in Vydon.

This role is currently the only role that may create Account API Keys. This is because today Account API Keys are not granular and effectively operate as account admins.

### Job Developer

This role is used to manage jobs within an account. It has access to view basic account information.

This role has permission to manage jobs and connections within the account.

### Job Executor

This role is used to execute jobs within an account. It has access to view basic account information.

This role has permission view connections and jobs within the account. It may also trigger job runs.

### Job Viewer

This role is used to view jobs within an account. It has access to view basic account information.

This role has permission to view jobs and connections within the account, but is not able to trigger job runs.
